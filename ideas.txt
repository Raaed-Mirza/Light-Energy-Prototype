- light up specific spaces in a room

- compare energy consumption(leaving the light on vs having the AI software running)
	- reduce on cost by reducing buffer
	- use pictures instead of video (e.g. 1 every minute)

- open source home assistant

- sensor outside of room detects sunlight, blinds won't affect light

- OpenCV => raspberry pi (low power)

- dimmable lights/switches
